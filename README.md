# Blue Topaz Labs
Building a community to boost extracurriculars and allow students to freely express themselves without appealing to the masses. The aim is for decentralisation and a social media platform that doesn't have a follower count which will help people be authentic and move beyond numbers.

### Frontend
(Deployed currently on Vercel, planned to deploy on Spheron, but the Build is getting failed.)

https://buidl-for-web3.vercel.app/

### Backend
(Currently deployed on Heroku)

https://buidl3.herokuapp.com/

## How do I self host this myself?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blue-topaz-labs/BuidlForWeb3
cd server
npm i
npm run dev
```

### Open a new terminal

```bash
cd client
npm i
npm run serve
```

Both the client and servers will start running on port 3000 and port 5000.
